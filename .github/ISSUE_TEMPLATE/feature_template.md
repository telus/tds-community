## Acceptance criteria

<!--
  TELUS guideline on writing acceptance criteria for development and QA
  Can be found on the Reference Architecture:
  https://github.com/telus/reference-architecture/blob/master/process/user-stories.md#how

  DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION

  Things to consider when writing acceptance criteria (ACs):

  Things to think about:

  -> What needs to be done to make this accessible?
  -> Visual properties
  -> Interactions
  -> Documentation
  -> Considerations if changes need to be mirrored to tds-core and tds-community
  -> Are there any responsive behaviours or visual differences?
  -> French considerations, do symbols or text need to be rendered in a certain order or manner?
  -> Text considerations, do we need SVGs, symbols, superscript text, or other special formatting?
  -> Make sure the ACs do not overly specify names of props. Try to stay generic and descriptive. Describe the interactions and behaviours of your component.

  Given...
  When...
  (And...)
  Then...
  (And...)

  Example:

    Given I am displaying the community-testimonial component

      When I supply an image
      And I supply testimonial text
      And I supply info
      Then the testimonial is displayed within a card with testimonial text
      And the testimonial image is displayed to the left of its info

      When I do not supply an image
      And I supply testimonial text
      And I supply info
      Then the testimonial is displayed within a card with testimonial text
