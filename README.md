# TELUS Design System Community <sup>beta</sup>

The TELUS Design System (TDS) is a set of living guidelines that communicates our brand promise through our digital experiences.
It's a holistic platform that integrates documentation, guidelines and design management that serves as single source for
digital design guidelines, code patterns and UI elements.

## Introduction

The TDS Community is a collaborative platform where TELUS designers and developers can rapidly discover, share, and consume
their modules as part of the TELUS Design System. This includes React components, the [component library for designers](https://tds.telus.com/getting-started/designers.html), and their documentation.

TDS Community is similar to [TDS Core](https://github.com/telus/tds-core) since community components
have the same technical and branding foundations as core components, however the underlying governance model and
maintenance workflow differs. Here is a high level summary:

| Feature               | TDS Core      | TDS Community                |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Component reusability | High          | Moderate                     |
| Rate of change        | Low           | High                         |
| Contribution speed    | Moderate      | High                         |
| Review board          | TDS Core Team | Digital Platform Ambassadors |

The [Digital Platform Ambassadors](https://github.com/orgs/telusdigital/teams/digital-platform-ambassadors) are a team
of representatives from every tribe at TELUS digital. They help grow the digital platform and will actively
review contributions for the TDS Community to ensure quality standards are met.

## Getting started

Consuming TDS Community Sketch assets or React components is very similar to TDS Core. You can follow our
[getting started](https://tds.telus.com/getting-started/getting-started.html) guide to learn more.

### For designers

During the initial launch of TDS Community, component designs will be audited by internal TELUS design
leads and will be delegated to their respective tribe developers for contribution. These notes will be updated
once an appropriate place for supplementary Sketch assets are decided.

### For developers

Unlike TDS Core, npm modules from TDS Community are prefixed `@tds/community-*`. To set up your project
to consume community or core components:

1.  Follow the [getting started guide for developers](https://tds.telus.com/getting-started/developers.html)
2.  Go to the [TDS Community catalogue](https://tds.telus.com/community/index.html) and choose a component to install
