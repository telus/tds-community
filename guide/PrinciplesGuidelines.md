## Community Principles

These 5 principles can be used to evaluate a component’s fit for TELUS Design System community components.

1. Must follow [digital design principles](https://tds.telus.com/design/principles.html)

2. Must have an identified use case in at least 2 unique applications

3. Must not include business logic or proprietary information

4. Must be sufficiently different than other pre-existing components

5. Should be sufficiently granular to promote reuse

  

> “As part of the design platform, Community components should simplify a team’s path to production, enabling team members to do what they want to do, easily.” ~ Harry McIntosh, Director

## Community Guidelines



1. Communicate early and often . Let the Community know what you are planning.

2. Community components have the most impact when shared across multiple situations, in many applications.

3. New designs and UX patterns must involve Design Direction to preserve a high-quality, consistent end customer experience.

4. Avoid including anything that may limit the breadth of reuse for a component - think functionally.

5. Design system components are focused on reusable user experience patterns. Keep business logic, API calls, content, or other application-specific behaviour in the application.

6. Any hard-coded strings, such as English phrases, must have the ability to be overridden in order to support multilingual applications

7. Community components reduce duplication by promoting flexibility and reuse of existing code.

8. Before creating a new component, consider whether an existing pattern and component is sufficient. If not, consider extending or adding features to an existing component before creating a new one.

8. Design system components should encapsulate a single pattern or user experience “element.” Seek to find the most granular, standalone, reusable pattern.
