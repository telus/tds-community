# TELUS Design System Community <sup>beta</sup>

The TELUS Design System (TDS) is a set of living guidelines that communicates our brand promise through our digital experiences. It's a holistic platform that integrates documentation, guidelines and design management that serves as single source for digital design guidelines, code patterns and UI elements.

## Introduction

The TDS Community is a collaborative platform where TELUS designers and developers can rapidly discover, share, and consume their modules as part of the TELUS Design System. This includes React components, the [component library for designers](https://tds.telus.com/getting-started/designers.html), and their documentation.

TDS Community is similar to [TDS Core](https://github.com/telus/tds-core) since community components have the same technical and branding foundations as core components, however the underlying governance model and maintenance workflow differs.
