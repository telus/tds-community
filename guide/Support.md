## DPA Discussion Channels

  

If you would like to have a discussion with the Digital Platform Ambassadors you can take advantage of the DPA [Github Discussion Board](https://github.com/orgs/telusdigital/teams/digital-platform-ambassadors/discussions).

Please remember that the DPA is a team of volunteers representing their outcome teams and looking out for the best interests of TELUS and the growth of the digital platform so responses may be delayed.
