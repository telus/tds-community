## Why invest in community

We recognize that the current business climate is about quicker and quicker releases. However, this can lead to an environment where short term thinking becomes the new normal.

TELUS leadership believes that sometimes you have to slow down to go faster, and that the Design System is one of those initiatives. They are asking you to invest up front in building Community components, knowing that later on the rewards to the entire TELUS ecosystem will be much greater.

## Platform thinking

The secret to platform thinking is asking 'Could anyone else benefit from this?'. If the answer is yes, then [submit an issue to TDS Community](https://github.com/telus/tds-community/issues/new/choose).

The DPA will let you know if something similar already exists, and your leads can help you prepare it for the community. They might offer design or development assistance, ask you to add a few additional requirements, or simply give the green light to put your component straight into the repo.

Now the toolbox just got a little bit bigger and everyone benefits so the next time you want to create a component you don’t have to start from scratch, you can now look in the [community catalogue](https://tds.telus.com/community/index.html) and see if anything comes close already.

You would simply request an alteration from the DPA or ask your Lead to make the change, and viola, you’ve saved time and effort and the toolbox just got a little bit bigger again.
