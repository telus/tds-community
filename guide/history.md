## History

### Q1 2017: Alpha

TELUS set out to create a framework for design. Design Strategy hired a team to help, resulting in a set of design standards, a master Sketch file, and a CSS pattern library.

### 2017, Q3: Beta

With the widespread adoption of the Digital Platform and Reference Architecture, the design system team decided to adopt React as a core technology to drive seamless integration with the applications.

### 2018, Q1: TDS Version 1

Version 1 was launched in January 2018. The design system has now reached a level of stability and maturity, completely adopting React, Sketch, and InVision DSM as core tools.

### 2018, Q2: TDS Split Components

In response to feedback from our early adopters we split TDS into individually versioned components. This allows for a much smoother upgrade path.

### 2018, Q3: TDS Community

To create the flexible, scalable solution that helps unlock each teams creativity we had to open up. Over the last 3 months we have put the following pieces in place:

- Developed community github repository
- Created Digital Platform Ambassadors to oversee ‘Open Governance’
- Helped facilitate initial TDS Community processes
