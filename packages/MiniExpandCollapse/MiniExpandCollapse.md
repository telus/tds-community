Similar to ExpandCollapse. Clicking on the hyperlink triggers target content to display in a panel directly below CTA.

### Usage criteria

- Mainly used to answer a question potentially posed by a user regarding information they could interpret as unclear
- Should provide more details than a Tooltip
- Expand/collapse titles should be kept short and if possible, sentence case should be used
- Titles should be lead by a strong action word
- Note: unlike `ExpandCollapse`, the panel housing the target content has no inherent spacing

```jsx
<MiniExpandCollapse
  collapseTitle="Why do I see a $5 one-time credit?"
  size={{ xs: 'small', md: 'medium' }}
>
  <Box vertical={4}>
    <Paragraph size="medium">
      As a TELUS customer, you pay one month in advance for your upcoming services. Because you
      changed your services mid-way through your billing cycle, we will:
    </Paragraph>
    <br />
    <UnorderedList size="medium">
      <UnorderedList.Item>
        Credit you for XX days you already paid for with you previous plan, but didn't use
      </UnorderedList.Item>
      <UnorderedList.Item>
        Charge you for the remaining XX days of your billing cycle based on the new plan and add-ons
        you just activated.
      </UnorderedList.Item>
    </UnorderedList>
    <br />
    <Paragraph size="medium">
      The difference between these amount is what forms the one-time credit you'll see on your next
      bill only.
